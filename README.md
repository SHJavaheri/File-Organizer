_**File Organizer**_
**Overview**
The **File Organizer** application helps you organize your files into designated folders based on their file types. It streamlines the process of managing your documents by categorizing them automatically.

**How It Works:**
When you run the application, it will prompt you to select a folder anywhere on your system that you want to organize.

**Important Note:**
- This version of the program does not organize folders within folders. It only organizes files in the selected folder.

**Organization Structure:**
The application will sort the files into specific folders based on their types. The following file types are organized as follows:
- Images: All PNG, JPG, and GIF files will be moved to a folder called Images.
- Music: MP3 and WAV files will be organized into a folder called Music.
- Programs: Executable files (EXE) will be placed in a folder named Programs.
- Documents: Common document files (like PDF, DOCX, etc.) will go into a folder called Documents.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the Executable: Double-click the FileOrganizer.exe file to launch the application.
2. Select a Folder: When prompted, choose the folder you wish to organize.
3. Let It Work: The application will automatically sort the files into their respective folders.

**Requirements:**
Currently only works on a Windows operating system (as this application is an EXE file).
