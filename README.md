# **File Organizer Overview**
The **File Organizer**, now renamed as Sortify, helps you organize your files into designated folders based on their file types. It streamlines the process of managing your documents by categorizing them automatically.

## **How It Works:**
When you run the application, it will prompt you to select a folder anywhere on your system that you want to organize. Once a folder has been selected, you can choose between sorting that folder, recursively sorting (sorting all folders as well within the initially selected folder), selecting a different folder, or simply undoing any sorting you have done.

## **Organization Structure:**
The application will sort the files into specific folders based on their types. The following file types are organized as follows:
- **Images:** All PNG, JPG, and GIF files will be moved to a folder called **Images**.
- **Music:** MP3 and WAV files will be organized into a folder called **Music**.
- **Programs:** Executable files (EXE) will be placed in a folder named **Programs**.
- **Documents:** Common document files (like PDF, DOCX, etc.) will go into a folder called **Documents**.
- ETC.

## **How to Use:**
1. **Run the Executable:** Double-click the **`.exe`** file to launch the application.
2. **Select a Folder:** When prompted, choose the folder you wish to organize.
3. **Choose an Option:** When prompted, choose what you want to do to that folder (Sort, Recursive Sort, Undo, ETC.).
4. **Let It Work:** The application will automatically sort the files into their respective folders.

## **Requirements:**
Currently, it only works on a **Windows** operating system (as this application is an EXE file).

## **Please note:**
When running the `.exe` file, you may receive a warning from Windows Defender SmartScreen indicating that the app is unrecognized. 

### **"Windows protected your PC. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."**

This is due to me not having a CSC (Code Signing Certificate). This simply means that I cannot put my own signature on the program just yet, causing Windows to be unfamiliar and distrust this application. This is a normal security precaution for newly distributed applications. Please be assured that `Sortify.exe` is completely safe. To run it, click on "More info" and then select "Run anyway."
